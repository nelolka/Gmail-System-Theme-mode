# Gmail-System-Theme-mode

Description:
This is a Google Chrome extension that makes Gmail turn dark mode or light mode depending on your browser system theme.
i.e. When your browser is on dark mode, your Gmail page turns to dark mode. Otherwise, if your browser is on light mode, the dark mode is disabled and your Gmail page returns to default theme mode.

Setup Instructions:

1 - Download the extension from the gitHub page and unzip the file

2 - Open "Manage extensions" on your browser

3 - Turn on "Develeper Mode"

4 - Click on "Load Unpacked"

5 - Select the extension folder

6 - Make sure is the extension toggle is On

7 - Open Gmail and see if it worked


Disclamers:
- This extension (probably) won't work with browsers that don't use Chromium.
- This extension works by inverting colors, so if your Gmail page has images on the background, this extension inverts those colors too,
(don't worry about the images of emails, profile images and label colors, those aren't inverted)
